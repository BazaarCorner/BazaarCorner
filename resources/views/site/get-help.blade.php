        <h3>How do I return the item I’ve purchased?</h3>
        <p>
            To return an item for refund or replacement:            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Find the item in the “Order Management” tab in your account
                    setting page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select “Reason  for Return” and it all depends on the
                    seller’s return policy preference. We may put you in touch
                    with the seller.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the seller uses Bazaar Corner hassle-free returns or 
                    chooses to use an Bazaar Corner-generated shipping label, we
                    provide you with a return shipping label and packing slip. 
                    If a shipping label isn't available for the item, we ask you
                    to contact the seller about <strong> alternative shipping arrangements</strong>.
                    The seller may also provide you their own shipping label.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Right after that, print the label, pack the item and return
                    it to seller not later than 5 days.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Before you request for a return item,  you must check seller’s
            return policy for return periods and other information.

    <section id="order-status">
        <h3>How to check the status of my order?</h3>
        <p>
            To view the status of your order you need to log-in into your Bazaar

            status of the items that you have bought.

    <section id="refund">
        <h3>How long does it take for me to get the refund?</h3>
        <p>It will take minimum of 7 days for you to get the refund.</p>
        <p>
            When the item isn’t as described we encourage our members to 
            communicate with each other when there is a problem with the 
            transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Sample computation:</em>
            <strong>
                *Total purchase price + **Original shipping cost = Total refund.
            </strong>
            <br><br>
            * (Inclusive of the item cost, other charges and tax)
            <br>
            **(paid by the buyer)
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="cancel-order">
        <h3>How to cancel a transaction?</h3>
        <p>
            When you need to cancel a transaction, you may need to contact the
            buyer first and let them  know  that you’re canceling the
            transaction. In this case you can cancel a transaction only 7 days
            after the sale and even if the buyer has already paid for the item.
        </p>
        <p>
            You wont be able to cancel  if the buyer has already opened/used the
            item. Multiple items of purchase can only cancel the whole
            transaction and not as per individual item that the buyer has bought.
